	<h1>Rush</h1>
    <p>In the 1970's during the grand prix an intense rivalry broke out between two racers with two very different personalites. James Hunt is a daring womanizer who is bold and aggressive on the track. Then there is Niki Louda, a very intillgent driver who calculates the risk of every move he makes on the track. During a race in Japan there was extremely heavy rainfall, the race should not have gone on, but Hunt swings the vote in favor of racing. Louda ends up getting hurt, which only adds to the rivalry.
